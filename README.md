# AgriTrust-Contracts

Smart contracts for managing trust streams with milestone completion proof hashing and integrated dispute resolution system on Stellar (Soroban WASM) and Ethereum/L2s (Solidity).

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Per-Second Streaming Accrual:** High-precision streaming logic using scaling factors on Soroban.
- **Legal Anchoring & Escrow:** Restricts fund streaming until legal documents are cryptographically signed on-chain, alongside an integrated arbitration escrow.
- **Multi-Chain Smart Contracts:** Soroban-based smart contract implementation alongside a Foundry/Solidity implementation supporting ZK proof verification.

## 📂 Workspace Structure

This is a Cargo workspace. Each directory under `contracts/` is an independent deployable Soroban WASM package.

| Package             | Path                          | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `grant_stream`      | `contracts/grant_stream`      | Core per-second token streaming contract. Handles milestone gating, circuit breakers, clawback, yield integration, dispute resolution, and governance. |
| `vesting_contracts` | `contracts/vesting_contracts` | Cliff and linear vesting schedules for team and investor token allocations.                                                                            |
| `arbitration`       | `contracts/arbitration`       | On-chain arbitration escrow. Supports multi-party dispute adjudication and escrow release logic.                                                       |
| `compliance`        | `contracts/compliance`        | Regulatory compliance screening layer — KYC/AML hooks, sanctions checks, and tax reporting utilities.                                                  |
| `zk_kyc`            | `contracts/zk_kyc`            | Zero-knowledge proof verification for privacy-preserving identity and KYC attestations.                                                                |

All packages share a single `soroban-sdk` version declared in the root `Cargo.toml` under `[workspace.dependencies]`. Individual crates reference it via `soroban-sdk = { workspace = true }`. To upgrade the SDK across the entire workspace, change the version in the root `Cargo.toml` only, then run `cargo update && cargo test --workspace`.

### Off-chain backend (`src/`)

The `src/` directory contains the Node.js off-chain service that bridges the Soroban contracts with external consumers. It is **not** a Rust/Cargo package and is not part of the workspace. Key directories:

| Directory        | Purpose                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/adapters/`  | On-chain adapter — translates raw Soroban XDR responses to JS.  |
| `src/routes/`    | Express route handlers (escrow read/write, etc.).               |
| `src/services/`  | Business-logic layer (escrowRead, escrowWrite, …).              |
| `src/middleware/`| Shared Express middleware (auth, validation, error handling).    |
